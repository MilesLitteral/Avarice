 Here is a basic implementation of using the `DAG` class with the Pillow library to output an image of the graph:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

class DAG:
    def __init__(self, graph=None):
        self.graph = graph if graph is not None else {}

    def add_edge(self, src, dest):
        self.graph.setdefault(src, []).append(dest)

    def remove_edge(self, src, dest):
        try:
            self.graph[src].remove(dest)
        except KeyError:
            pass

    def draw(self, filename):
        width, height = 1024, 1024
        img = Image.new('RGB', (width, height))
        draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)

        visited = set()
        def dfs(node, adj):
            for child in adj:
                if child not in visited:
                    draw.line((node[0], node[1], child[0], child[1]), fill=(0, 0, 0))
                    dfs(child, adj[child])

        for node, adj in self.graph.items():
            if node not in visited:
                dfs((node, 0, 0), adj)
                visited.add(node)

        img.save(filename)
```

This implementation assumes that the `DAG` class holds a dictionary of `src` node to a list of `dest` nodes. The `draw` method iterates over all nodes in the graph and uses a depth-first search to traverse the graph. The `ImageDraw.draw` function is used to draw lines between nodes. You can create an instance of `DAG` and use the `add_edge` and `remove_edge` methods to modify the graph. Finally, call the `draw` method to create an image file of the graph. 

Example usage:

```python
import random

dag = DAG()

for i in range(10):
    dag.add_edge(random.randint(0, 10), random.randint(0, 10))

dag.draw('example.png')
```

Note that this is a simple implementation that only handles a small number of nodes, and does not take into account the complexity of large graphs. Additional features such as displaying node labels and maximizing the use of space would require more advanced graph drawing algorithms.
