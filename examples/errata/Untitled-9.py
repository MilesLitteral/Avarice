Sure! Here's an example scenario:

Consider a server-side online chat application where multiple clients can send and receive messages concurrently. Each client has a unique identifier (e.g., user_id) and a JSON-like object representing their client state (e.g., online status, current room, etc.). When a client sends a message, the server needs to update the client's state to reflect the message being sent. Multiple clients can send messages simultaneously, so we need to ensure that client states are updated atomically and safely.

Here's a simplified code snippet using the STMData class:

from stm import STMManager

class ClientState:
    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.state = {}
        self.manager = STMManager()

    def send_message(self, message):
        with self.manager.start_transaction() as log:
            log["state"]["last_sent_message"] = message
            log["state"]["last_sent_at"] = datetime.now()
            log["state"]["is_online"] = True

        self.manager.commit_transaction(log)

# Server-side code
server = Server()

# Handle a client request to send a message
def handle_send_message(client_id, message):
    client_state = server.get_client_state(client_id)
    client_state.send_message(message)

# Update client state when a message is sent
def update_client_state(client_id, message):
    client_state = server.get_client_state(client_id)

    # Start a transaction to update the client state
    with client_state.manager.start_transaction() as log:
        log["state"]["last_sent_message"] = message
        log["state"]["last_sent_at"] = datetime.now()

    # Commit the transaction to make the changes visible to other threads
    client_state.manager.commit_transaction(log)
In this example, each ClientState instance maintains a JSON-like object representing the client's state, which is updated atomically using STM when a message is sent or received. The send_message method creates a new transaction, updates the client state, and then attempts to commit the transaction.

When a client sends a message, the handle_send_message method fetches the client's current state, updates it using STM, and then saves the new state back to the server.

Note that in a real-world scenario, you'd likely need to handle conflicts and transaction retries, ensure consistency when multiple clients send messages simultaneously, and perform additional bookkeeping. This is just a simplified example to illustrate how STM can be used in practice.
